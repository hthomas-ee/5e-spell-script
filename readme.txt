Hello Thank you for using my script!

There are currently 3 main functions: search, class_list, class_print

Search: Just type whatever spell you're looking for and hit enter. Unfortunately there is no points
for close guesses. You have to be exactly right. The program will then list all of the spells and 
their that match your search. You then input the index and the spell description will appear!

class_list: Enter one of the following letters for their respective class (A=Artificier, B=Bard, C=Cleric, D=Druid,
P = Paladin, R = Ranger, S = Sorcerer, W = Warlock, Z = Wizard). Then you input the first spell level of the range of
spell levels you wish to list and hit enter. Enter the last spell level of the range of spell levels you wish to list.
0 counts for cantrips. E.g. If you want all Cleric spells enter C, then 0, then 9.

class_print: The same as class_list, but this will print the spell descriptions as well.
